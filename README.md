# Shades
Python animator using OpenGL and PyCairo

I am a hobbyist, and I'm working on this project for my own amusement. 
Feel free to use it or not, but I make no guarantees on its ability to function.
I also won't be able to help you in a professional sense since I don't really know what I'm doing.
Thanks!
